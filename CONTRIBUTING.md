# Contributing to the Folder Properties Plugin

Plugin source code is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/jenkinsci/folder-properties-plugin).
New feature proposals and bug fix proposals should be submitted as [GitHub pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request).
Your pull request will be evaluated by the [Jenkins job](https://ci.jenkins.io/job/Plugins/job/folder-properties-plugin/).

Before submitting your change, please assure that you've added tests that verify the change.

## Development requirements

Use a full JDK 21 and Maven 3.9.6 or newer. The plugin targets Jenkins 2.555.3
LTS and newer releases and does not support building or running on Java 17.

## Code formatting

Source code and pom file formatting is maintained by the `spotless` maven plugin.
Before submitting a pull request, confirm the formatting is correct with:

* `mvn spotless:apply`

## Spotbugs checks

Please don't introduce new spotbugs output.

* `mvn spotbugs:check` analyzes the project using [Spotbugs](https://spotbugs.github.io)
* `mvn spotbugs:gui` displays the spotbugs report using GUI

## Code coverage

Code coverage reporting is available as a Maven profile. The build enforces a
minimum of 90% line coverage and 80% branch coverage whenever JaCoCo execution
data is available. Please improve or preserve coverage with tests when you
submit pull requests.

* `mvn -Penable-jacoco clean verify` reports and checks code coverage

### Reviewing code coverage

The code coverage report shows methods and lines executed.
The following commands will open the `index.html` file in the browser.

* Windows - `start target\site\jacoco\index.html`
* Linux - `xdg-open target/site/jacoco/index.html`
* Gitpod - `cd target/site/jacoco && python -m http.server 8000`

The file will have a list of package names.
Click on them to find a list of class names.

The lines of the code will be covered in three different colors, red, green, and orange.
Red lines are not covered in the tests.
Green lines are covered with tests.
